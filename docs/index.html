<h2>Welcome to the DMX Cross Project</h2>
<p>
Right now the project is still not complete for a large scale release.
You might be able to contribute or setup a clone from what is here already, but the deployment and distribution
process still is work in progress.
Currently Live Test are run twice each week and feature set, tools and documentation is completed.
